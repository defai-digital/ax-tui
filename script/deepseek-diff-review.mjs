/**
 * DeepSeek diff review gate: runs the final BASELINE..HEAD diff past a
 * headless deepseek CLI and asserts an explicit verdict.
 *
 * Contract:
 * - The CLI is located on PATH or in common install dirs. `DEEPSEEK_CLI`
 *   overrides the binary path. Absence fails loudly (exit 2).
 * - The review prompt is fully self-contained (diff inlined, tools
 *   disabled) and bounded in size.
 * - The child process runs under a hard timeout (default 600s,
 *   `DEEPSEEK_REVIEW_TIMEOUT_MS` overrides) and is killed on expiry (exit 3).
 * - A zero exit code without an explicit `FINDINGS` / `NO-FINDINGS` verdict
 *   is a failure (exit 4).
 *
 * CLI invocation contract: the prompt is piped on STDIN with tool flags
 * disabled (`--no-tools` when the CLI understands it; `DEEPSEEK_REVIEW_ARGS`
 * overrides the extra argument list wholesale).
 *
 * Exit codes: 0 = verdict captured, 1 = FINDINGS reported (gate signal for
 * the caller to triage), 2 = CLI not found, 3 = timeout, 4 = no verdict.
